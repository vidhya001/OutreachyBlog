I am selected in Moja Global as an Outreachy intern this may’2021. <br> I am an optimistic individual, love to explore and learn new things.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">
                  Here are the three Core values, I beleive <br>
                  <b>Patience</b><br>
                  When everything around us is changing, when the world is difficult to understand ,our core values will always be there for us. I believe in patience ,yes I agree Patience is bitter but I also agree its fruit is sweet. <br>
                  <b>Positive Attitude</b><br>
                  Our attitude matters in every part of the life. We need to have a positive attitude in dealing with new challenges. Also,
                  One need to have positive attitude while waiting.<br>
                  <b>Perseverance</b><br>
                  Perseverance, major character trait for one to be successful in life here I like to add my favorite quote "The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying". <br>Situations in our lives keep on changing constantly and quite unexpectedly too.  The ability to accept what you control and what you can't control is required in life.<br>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">The first time, I came across Outreachy is during my first year while I was going through various open-source programs that would happen every year. I found this program interesting encouraging all kinds of people around the world and involving them in various open-source projects. I have been following the Outreachy program since then. I have seen many posts blogs from people all around the world and I contacted them through various platforms to know their views, experiences on this Internship. That’s where I realized the importance of the Outreachy program.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">When the initial application for the Outreachy &nbsp;May’2021 was announced I was very nervous with a lot of questions raised in my mind about whether I can be part of such a big program? Am I skilled enough to take part in any organization? Many such doubts. But by making myself calm and settled, I started looking at reasons to participate in the program rather than the thoughts or the questions that are pulling me back. I then filled my initial application and waiting for its approval.<br> The day when I got a mail telling me that my initial application was accepted, that’s where I got confidence and wanted to crack the program no matter what.

                  The interesting part of the program is the contribution period. Initially, I was very confused to choose an organization. I contacted past interns and taken their suggestions about the things we need to during the contribution period. These helped me a lot. I choose Moja Global as my organization, the project is to perform profiling and benchmarking on the FLINT module. I was completely new to the organization, but I was determined to give my 100% effort regardless of the result. I was active throughout the contribution period and made some contributions. Finally, the much-awaited day came with positive news that I am part of Outreachy’2021. I am happy that I am one of the 71 interns in the world. I am excited to be part of<a href="https://moja.global" class="text-primary"> Moja Global</a> and looking forward to a great summer.

                I found Moja Global very interesting to work with. It has an great community where people are always encouraging and supportive. The mentors present are very awesome, it feels like you were part of the organization once you get started. 
                <br>As a part of outreachy, I will be working on Profiling and Benchmarking the FLINT and FLINT Modules. FLINT stands for Full Land Integration Tool, which is the core framework for Moja Global. <br>
